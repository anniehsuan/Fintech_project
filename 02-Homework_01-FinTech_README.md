    Alipay now is operating under Ant Financial as one of the subsidiaries. Thus, it is managed by Eric Jing and Cheng Li,  the CEO and the CTO of Ant Group respectively.
     
### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    The mission of Ant Group is to create inclusive and sustainable financial services to each individual so that people regardless of the social status or background can easily access online financial services when necessary. However, the foundation of the full-financial services is established from the Alipay mobile payment network. The idea of such mobile payments rides on the emerging e-commerce expansion in China, where customers consuming behaviours have changed from shopping at stores to ordering everything online with even greater demand, especially through mobile devices. Thus, streamlining mobile payment could remove friction during the checkout process, and bring a more convenient shopping environment where individuals can buy anything anytime anywhere. It further allows companies to supply the rising demand from E-commerce. The core edge behind this well-established payment system it that all customers' data and information can be easily collected for future analysis purposes and the Ant Group can leverage the data and expand it to various angles of financial service such as loans, asset management, and insurance etc to create a well-established ecosystem.  
### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Round A: Formerly known as Ant Financial, Ant Group was funded by China Investment Corp (CIC), CCB Trust, China Life, China Post Group, China Development Bank Capital and Primavera Capital Group in the amount of $4.5 billion in 2015 Q3.

    Round C: In 2019, the company was funded for an additional $1 billion for the sake of business expansion in South and Southeast Asia.


## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    Alipay is a third-party mobile and online payment platform. The app serves as a pre-loaded service of users' debit or credit cards, which allows users to execute any types of transactions on a mobile phone.

    - 2C: Since Alipay and Yuâ€™EBao service (a money market find deposit platform) are interconnected. Customers tend to deposits the excess cash in such accounts and earn relatively high-interest gain compared to the bank's offerings. 

    - 2B: Alipay also solves the problem of the credit scoring database. In the past, borrowers need to provide a bunch of documents to demonstrate they can pay off the debt timely. Yet, the fact is that most of the people are even unable to get microloan due to ineffective supporting documents. The Ant Group wants to solve the issue and provides more accessible microloans to the public. Alipay can now serve as a 2B database service to the credit scoring entity, Sesame Credit. Alipay transactions platform could monitor individuals' cash flows and consuming activities and assist in the AI computation of judging individuals' pay-off ability.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    - Market share: As of December 2019, Alipay seized 54.5% of China mobile payment transactions market
    - Market size: In 2019, the mobile payments transactions in China has reached 720 billion, valuing at around 40 trillion USD

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? 
    Tencent pay is connected to the social network platform called Wechat, while Alipay is connected to the e-commerce services and transactions. This difference creates the gap of customer base, transaction types, and transaction amounts betweem two companies.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 

**BASIC** : Blockchain, AI, Security, IoT, Computing,  is the Ant Group's technological foundation. In terms of Fintech, the company has applied more in Blockchain, AI and Computing.

    - AI: AlphaRisk risk management(Risk Perception, AI Detect, Evolution) to minimize the rate of credit loss to less than 1/10M, and also improve the machine learning process of risk detection within the risk management control. 
 
    - Robo Advisor: serving over 500M people per day on Alipay to deal with basic customer issues
    - Blockchain and & Payment: Oceanbase and blockchain-powered real-time cash transferring between Hong Kong and the Philippines with international settlements and reconciliation systems. By applying IoT and blockchain, Alipay can verify transactions through dual authentication and two-way encryption with a high accuracy rate.

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    The Ant Group has covered a lot of substreams of financial services, including payments, microloans, insurance brokerage, and wealth management platform. Focusing on Alipay, it is more about the centralized payment system.
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    The major trend under mobile payments is not limited to eliminating physical money transfer. The Ant Group has integrated higher interest saving account with Alipay, where customers can save the remaining balance to the saving account and benefit from higher interest gains. Thus, it gradually becomes a "2C" digital wallet and wealth management platform. The next application that the Ant Group has worked on is to combine the mutual fund investment services with the existing Alipay services, which allows customers to access the money market services to the capital market services all at once.

    Nowadays, the mobile payment services move from the online scanning payment to a stage of "smart terminal NFC" and "offline code scanning payment" in China. 2019Q3 data shows that YoY rates of smart NFC transactions increased by 56% in China, while the offline code scanning payment transactions increased by around 8%. Additionally, since Covid19 has changed individuals' behaviours to eliminate physical contact, the total mobile payments transactions and monthly active users have boosted a lot. It provides another opportunity for the Ant Group to collect even more users' information and cash flows that the company can leverage on shortly. 


### What are the other major companies in this domain?
    The mobile payments and transactions market is an oligopoly structure in China. 2 key players are Tenpay and Alipay, taking around 95% of the market share together in China.   
        - Tencent' Tenpay: 40% market share
        - Alipay: 55% market share
        - Ping An Group's Yiqianbao: 2% market share
        - JD Pay: 	1% market share

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
- Product Line 1: Social Networking Market

    Compared to Alipay's main competitors,Tenpay, Alipay is not actively capturing the business of payments regarding social activities (red envelope, birthday wishes etc). Thus, it is believed that if the Alipay can create another product line to join the maturing social networking market, the horizontal integration could earn more profits and steal the market share from Tenpay simultaneously.


- Product line 2: Face Scan Payment (Advanced)

    Using face recognition to execute the payments is safer than using the traditional password as every individual Biometrics is different and irreplaceable. Thus, for security purposes, it can better protect the information from leaking. The Face Scan Payment is still at the early stage of development in China, where the MAU is still leaving behind the direct scan method. However, it will become a trend not only because people do not have to memorize those many different types of passwords, but because that the portability and processing time of the face scan method is expected to be faster than the QR code method. It can also assist the elder group or less tech-savvy users to join using such a payment method, potentially increasing the usage of the mobile payment market.
